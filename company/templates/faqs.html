                        Fresh air is coffee's greatest enemy. Oxygen and moisture within the air are quickly absorbed by
                        the roasted beans, at the expense of their inherently delicious flavours.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        When a bag is opened, in general, wholebean coffee begins to lose its flavour when left out
                        after one week, while ground coffee can do so within an hour of opening. If you are using
                        wholebean coffees, store them in their bags at room temperature, out of direct sunlight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Never store your coffee in the fridge - not even in an air-tight container. Fresh roasted coffee
                        is incredibly hygroscopic, and will quickly absorb odours in the air. A fridge normally contains
                        strong aromas, which will then be transferred to your cup.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The best way to store coffee is in the freezer. This is because the inert environment will help
                        to lock in the fine flavours over a much longer period of time. This method of storage is
                        especially recommended if you are a low volume user of fresh, ground coffee.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        When taking coffee out for brewing after freezing it, always ensure that you take out only as
                        little as is needed, and return the rest of the pack back to the freezer, immediately. This is
                        because if kept out for long periods of time, condensation will form on the grounds, and thus
                        destroy the flavours, particularly if this water is then re-frozen. Coffee does not like
                        frequent extreme changes of temperature.

                        Why is important for coffee to be fresh?

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Coffee freshness is important because coffee loses its qualities over time at the contact of
                        oxygen and humidity, which is why we recommend you to store your coffee in a tight and sealed
                        container once it is open.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Because of the minuscule particle size pre-ground coffee is much more exposed to this staling
                        process and will start losing its quality and taste within a few days. We flush the bags with
                        nitrogen to force the oxygen out and prevent oxidation- however once the bag seal is opened, the
                        coffee will be exposed to air again and should be used quickly!
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Never store your coffee in the fridge - not even in an air-tight container. Fresh roasted coffee
                        is incredibly hygroscopic, and will quickly absorb odours in the air. A fridge normally contains
                        strong aromas, which will then be transferred to your cup.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        On the other hand coffee can also be too fresh. It may sound odd that a coffee can be too fresh,
                        but the roasting process creates carbon dioxide inside the beans which takes several days to
                        slowly escape. This carbon dioxide creates microscopic gas pockets which prevents the brewing
                        water from fully extracting the flavours and this effect is magnified by the high pressure
                        espresso machines apply to the coffee.
