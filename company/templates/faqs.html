                        Fresh air is coffee's greatest enemy. Oxygen and moisture within the air are quickly absorbed by
                        the roasted beans, at the expense of their inherently delicious flavours.
                        <br />
                        When a bag is opened, in general, wholebean coffee begins to lose its flavour when left out
                        after one week, while ground coffee can do so within an hour of opening. If you are using
                        wholebean coffees, store them in their bags at room temperature, out of direct sunlight.
                        <br />
                        Never store your coffee in the fridge - not even in an air-tight container. Fresh roasted coffee
                        is incredibly hygroscopic, and will quickly absorb odours in the air. A fridge normally contains
                        strong aromas, which will then be transferred to your cup.
                        <br />
                        The best way to store coffee is in the freezer. This is because the inert environment will help
                        to lock in the fine flavours over a much longer period of time. This method of storage is
                        especially recommended if you are a low volume user of fresh, ground coffee.
                        <br />
                        When taking coffee out for brewing after freezing it, always ensure that you take out only as
                        little as is needed, and return the rest of the pack back to the freezer, immediately. This is
                        because if kept out for long periods of time, condensation will form on the grounds, and thus
                        destroy the flavours, particularly if this water is then re-frozen. Coffee does not like
                        frequent extreme changes of temperature.
